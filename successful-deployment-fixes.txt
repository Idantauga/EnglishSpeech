# Successful Fixes for Vercel Deployment

## Key Changes That Fixed the 404 Issue

1. **Simplified vercel.json Configuration**
   - Changed from complex builds/routes to a more direct approach
   - Used the newer Vercel configuration format with buildCommand and outputDirectory
   - Added proper rewrites to handle both API and frontend routes
   - Increased memory allocation for serverless functions

2. **Fixed Build Process**
   - Updated build command to use `npx craco build` instead of just `craco build`
   - Moved @craco/craco from devDependencies to regular dependencies
   - Updated scripts in package.json to use npx for running craco

3. **API Configuration**
   - Created a standalone API implementation in api/index.js
   - Added proper package.json in the api directory with type: "module"
   - Simplified the serverless function to avoid file system operations

4. **Project Structure**
   - Created a proper monorepo structure with client and api directories
   - Added installation scripts for all parts of the application
   - Created a fallback index.html in the root directory

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up proper environment variables for production
   - Updated CORS settings to allow requests from all Vercel domains
   - Configured client to use relative API paths in production

## Most Important Fix

The most critical change was updating the vercel.json configuration to use the newer format with:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "cd client && npm install && npx craco build",
  "outputDirectory": "client/build",
  "framework": "create-react-app",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/api/:path*", "destination": "/api/:path*" },
    { "source": "/:path*", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

This properly tells Vercel:
1. How to build the client application
2. Where to find the built files
3. How to route requests between the frontend and API

## Lessons Learned

1. Use the newer Vercel configuration format when possible
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed in the right locations
3. Use npx to run CLI tools to avoid PATH issues
4. Set up proper rewrites to handle both frontend and API routes
5. Configure CORS to allow requests from all relevant domains
6. Use relative API paths in the frontend for production
7. Create standalone API implementations for serverless functions
